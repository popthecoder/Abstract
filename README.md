# Abstract Help Center Clone

This is a responsive **HTML and CSS clone** of the Abstract Help Center landing page. The goal of this project was to practice clean layout structure, flexbox/grid usage, and mobile responsiveness without using JavaScript.

- Navigation bar with action buttons
- Centered search section with call-to-action
- Grid-based help article cards
- Organized footer with useful links
- Clean and modern UI using Flexbox and CSS Grid

## 📱 Responsiveness

This site uses a mobile-first approach with a media query targeting devices under `768px` width. Elements like the navbar, search bar, and help cards automatically adapt to smaller screens, keeping a consistent and user-friendly layout.
